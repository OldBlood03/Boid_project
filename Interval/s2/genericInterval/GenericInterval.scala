/*
 * The goal of this exercise is to practice generalization of an existing class.
 * This is a relatively normal refactoring procedure, when it is noticed that old code
 * can be used in a wider context than was initially planned.
 *
 * In the original exercise on round 3, the goal was to implement the class Interval which handled
 * a time interval between  two Moment objects. The exercise involved implementations for a number of methods including
 * union, intersection etc. which are common for intervals of any type.
 *
 * In this exercise, you will pull your old Interval class from naphtalene and create a
 * parameterized version GenericInterval[T] of it. The greatest part of the functionality offered by the Moment class
 * was related to comparing Moment objects, which was crucial for the proper functionality of the Interval class.
 * We will generalize this, too, by offering an Ordering[T] object with the Interval class can perform exactly the same comparisons.
 *
 * One feature that Ordering[T] cannot offer, and which the original Interval class used,
 * is the distance between two "moments". This is conciously omitted in the GenericInterval[T] class.
 * The length was used only in the toString method anyway so does not affect any other methods.

/** Each instance of the class `GenericInterval` represents an interval -- an inclusive range -- on
  * a scale. An interval has a "start" and an "end", represented as objects of type T. An interval
  * always contains at least a single item.
  *
  * An interval object may be used represent a range of just about anything that has an Ordering.
  *
  * An `Interval` object is immutable after it has been created. That is, its state can not be
  * changed in any way.
  *
  * @param start
  *   the start of the interval (that is, the first item included in the interval)
  * @param end
  *   the end of the interval (that is, the last item included in the interval); equal to or higher
  *   than `start`
