Feel free to copy this code, but be sure not to tell anyone about it;
If you are having trouble with coding, losing hope, perhaps getting frustrated,
please use these resources so you don't lose your patience.

The working code will always be on the master branch, 
and the latest version should include the code for the weeks assignments.
On other branches, you can look at the work-in-progress, but copy at your own risk.
